# GlyphLens: Field Simulation Web Demo

This is a public web-based simulation of the GlyphLens project â€” a pictographic decoding tool that reconstructs civilizational timelines from ancient glyphs, geoglyphs, and terrain scans.

---

## ðŸŒ€ What It Does
Upload a glyph image and simulate a decode vignette revealing the:
- Operator archetype
- Spiritual circuitry
- Sonic overlay
- Geo-temporal markers
- Terrain correlations
- Cymatic Earth resonance

---

## ðŸ§ª Live Field Use Simulation
This version is a **non-functional demo** simulating what live decoding will feel like.
- Upload an image to test the UI
- Trigger a vignette to preview narrative synthesis

---

## ðŸ›¡ Module Logic is Sacred
> _"What you see is resonance. What we calculate is protected."_

Decode logic, archetypal indexing, and waveform classifiers remain protected intellectual property. This open demo respects the userâ€™s curiosity while guarding the deeper code.

## ðŸ§  Built With
- React + Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn/UI components
- Vite.js (via StackBlitz)
